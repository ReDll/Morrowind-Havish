INFO:973661052829528534=Here, take the book back. Go down to the lyceum, the forcefield that blocks the way to Теодистир Хомоис's laboratory in the cellar will now open for you. Time you learn to know Theodistyr. Show him Ergestin's logbook, he might be able to tell you more about that Grimward.
INFO:97425523120455867=Thank you again %PCName. Finally my teleportation chamber is really useful.
INFO:975822388162171201=Мехиндрел said that he bought the gloves from Лонас Ромарен, a local merchant, that runs the "Залог и Заем" shop. Maybe I should talk to this man.
INFO:9788177481018228807=It started a couple of months ago, wild animals are suddenly appearing in town, plants are growing wildly, the weather changes like crazy. Yes, such things happen, but not that frequently and intense like they do here in Хавиш.
INFO:979725229906523789=Гильдия Воров: Damsel in Distress
INFO:98441954840525239=OK, we both draw a new card.
INFO:984619407110184357=I think it's time for an active move against those animals.
INFO:985427111148210110=Гемандил was of no help. She thinks Nergel is just very lucky.
INFO:9862029137076575=Just when captain Hansol wanted to tell me who lured him into the trap, the traitor showed up. It's Фариен Андоис, one of Берин's men. After some rambling he attacked the captain and me.
INFO:987516241146910439=Even though freelance whoremasters, pickpockets, catburglars, swindlers, and muggers exist, most professional criminals in Tamriel belong to the Гильдия Воров. It is best for the collective whole, and the Guild exerts a certain ... pressure to join.
INFO:9899265112241428=My teleportation chamber is able to transport you to the Mages Guild halls in Ald'Ruhn, Balmora, Caldera, Sadrith Mora and Vivec, as well as to the cities of Дагон Фел, Гнисис, Суран and Тель Вос. Free for you and any of your companions of course. Where do you want to go?
INFO:990628160134484469=%Name has seen nobody who looks like that.
INFO:9911302711175413347=How can %Name serve you?
INFO:991931487528912125=Exactly. Goodbye.
INFO:994430682171824586=I reported back to Элерет and told her that the thefts have stopped and Lonas will pay us again. A better reputation in the guild might keep Narni from working against the guild's orders. I told Элерет that there was a freelancer thief working in the shop, and Narni helped me to chase him away. Элерет thanked me for my part in the job and will think about a raise in rank for Narni.
INFO:995054702681823539=This is pointless. I need a material component to prevent the spell from collapsing before the effect stabilizes. Do you have a ruby with you?
INFO:996813461532225380=Greetings mortal, I intend no harm. I know that Тробир was a true follower to Molag Bal and never intended to do such a heresy. But nonetheless, he had to pay for such a poor offering. I know you're looking for the same person as I, the blasphemer that stole the original amulet, and sold that worthless copy to Тробир.
INFO:99741472592314666=Yes. This is the Fighters Guild. Карус Варио is the steward.
INFO:9987112812979019236=I gave the ring to Эрденис. After all it was I that got it out of the palace.
